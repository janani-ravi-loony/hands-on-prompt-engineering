Notebook LM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


# **NotebookLM** was an AI-powered research and writing assistant developed by Google. Its core purpose was to help users understand and work with their own documents and notes more effectively using the power of large language models.

# * **Document-Centric AI:** Unlike general-purpose chatbots, NotebookLM was designed to be grounded in the documents you provided. You could upload or link various types of text-based content, such as notes, PDFs, research papers, transcripts, and more.

# * **Intelligent Question Answering:** You could ask NotebookLM questions about the content in your uploaded documents, and it would provide answers based on that specific information. This was much more targeted and relevant than asking a general search engine or chatbot.


# Go to 

https://notebooklm.google/

# Create a new notebook

# Note all the different types of sources
# We could add sources manually

# However, recently, they added a feature to detect sources with AI

# Click on that button and say "2016 NBA season"

# This will find some sources - select some of them

# Add more sources with "2016 NBA Final"
# This will add yet more sources
# Select the YT sources from here (it uses the YT transcripts to get its information)

# In basketball, "The Block" is LeBron's defensive play in the finals

# Ask NotebookLM "What is the block?"

# It will give you an in-context answer

# After asking a question, click on any citation - it will show the text from there


------------------------

# Add the YT video of the block to the source

# Refresh so the old chat is lost

# Ask this question


Can you describe how the block was executed?

# Show that it uses YT transcripts

# Save this to note by clicking on "Save to note"

# This is how you save chats


-----------------------

# Now for the main feature - click on Audio Overview

Can you tell me about the block?
