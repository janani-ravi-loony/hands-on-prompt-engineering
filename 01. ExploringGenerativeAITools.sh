# Perplexity AI and ChatGPT are both AI tools, but they differ significantly in their primary function. Perplexity primarily functions as an AI search engine, focusing on real-time information retrieval and research, while ChatGPT is a conversational AI chatbot designed for natural language interaction and creative content generation.

# If you're on a paid ChatGPT plan (Plus, Pro, Team, or Enterprise), you can switch between models with the model selector.

# Users on the Free tier will be defaulted to GPT-4o with a limit on the number of messages they can send using GPT-4o, which will vary based on current usage and demand. When unavailable, Free tier users will be switched back to GPT-4o mini.

# Back to GPT 4 (Very open-ended prompt, will give you very open ended responses)
What kind of software tools and technologies should I learn today?

# Provide some context with your prompt, you will get more useful responses
I like working with data analysis and interpretation. What tools and technologies should I learn today?

# New GPT-4o session - with no context

# It has no idea and will ask a follow up question
Could you recommend some places to stay there?

# It will suggest places to stay in Vermont (remembers context)
I have heard Vermont is beautiful at this time of the year

# Follow up
How should I get there from SFO?

# Gemini

# Uses a completely different model
# Bard (now Gemini) used to be powered by Google’s LaMDA and PaLM 2 language models, but now  Gemini uses Gemini Flash

# Google’s Gemini language models – Pro, Ultra, and Nano – are “natively multimodal”, which means it’s trained a variety of inputs, not just text. Google has also fine-tuned the model with more multimodel information. They can also access the internet in real time.

# Anthropic's Claude

# Claude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic.[1] The first model was released in March 2023. Claude 3, released in March 2024, can also analyze images.[2]

# Claude 3 Haiku: Fast and cost-effective

# Claude 3 Sonnet: Balances speed and intelligence

# Claude 3 Opus: Excels at complex tasks and higher-order math

# Claude models are generative pre-trained transformers. They have been pre-trained to predict the next word in large amounts of text. Claude models have then been fine-tuned with Constitutional AI with the aim of making them helpful, honest, and harmless.[3][4]

# Constitutional AI is an approach developed by Anthropic for training AI systems, particularly language models like Claude, to be harmless and helpful without relying on extensive human feedback. The method, detailed in the paper "Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback" involves two phases: supervised learning and reinforcement learning.[4]

# In the supervised learning phase, the model generates responses to prompts, self-critiques these responses based on a set of guiding principles (a "constitution"), and revises the responses. Then the model is fine-tuned on these revised responses.[4]

# Microsoft Copilot

# Uses multiple Open AI's models and other models to power its chat 

# Copilot utilizes the Microsoft Prometheus model. This model is based on OpenAI's GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o large language models. It also uses a component called the Orchestrator, which generates search queries to combine Bing search results with the OpenAI models. In addition, Copilot uses the DALL-E 3 model for image generation.
