Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the most advanced model, optimized for complex coding and agentic tasks, while Claude Haiku 4.5 is a faster and more cost-effective option that matches the coding performance of the previous Sonnet 4 model.

# Microsoft Copilot

# Uses multiple Open AI's models and other models to power its chat 

# Copilot utilizes the Microsoft Prometheus model. This model is based on OpenAI's GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o large language models. It also uses a component called the Orchestrator, which generates search queries to combine Bing search results with the OpenAI models. In addition, Copilot uses the DALL-E 3 model for image generation.
