# Name the app

Gag Coffee

----------

Could you set up a home page for a local coffee shop named Gag Coffee. Please use their theme colors (a bright red and pale yellow). The main page should evoke vibes of coffee and meeting friends.

# Show that it works on different devices

# Switch to the code and show

----------

Could you include a photo of steaming cup of coffee behind the text "Your Daily Dose of Joy" (in the hero section)

# Link the menu

Could you create a page for the menu link on the top right? Show a full page menu image with all the standard items you would expect in a coffee shop

# This does not work very well

----------

# Upload coffee_menu.png

Just update this to point to the local coffee_menu.png that I have uploaded
