Please read in the bike buyers dataset and display a sample of the dataframe?

I am going to use this dataset to train a classification model to predict whether users purchased a bike or not. Could you show me a distribution of records for the two categories?

Do you think there are any irrelevant features in the data that would not be useful to predict bike purchases? Could you identify and drop the irrelevant features and display the resulting dataframe?

Could you please split the data into training and test data so I can train and evaluate my classification model? I'd like to use 80% of the data to train the model and 20% for evaluation

Could you identify the type of encoding that we should apply to each of the categorical columns? (please explain why in your response). Then please set up the preprocessor that I can then use to apply the encoding to the training and test data? Please do this step by step, showing the output at each step

Could you please train a logistic regression model to predict bike purchases using the selected features? Display the confusion matrix for the model on the test data and then evaluate the model on the test data using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Please do this step by step
